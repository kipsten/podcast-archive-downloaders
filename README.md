# podcast-archive-downloaders
Download the full archives of the programming podcasts "Hanselminutes" and ".NET Rocks!". 
Podcast clients sometimes don't give you the ability to download the full archives of certain podcasts, so I made these for
myself.

Specify the range of podcasts you want to download by editing variables at the top of the code files. There are also
variables for the download folders. I though this was actually a little simpler than providing a command-line interface, because
editing the variables is trivial, and it also gives you a chance to take a look at what the code is doing.
